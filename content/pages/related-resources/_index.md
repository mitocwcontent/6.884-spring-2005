[Online Verilog HDL Quick Reference Guide](http://www.emmelmann.org/Library/Tutorials/docs/verilog_ref_guide/vlog_ref_top.html): Very useful online reference for Verilog-1995. It won't have the newer Verilog-2001 constructs but it is still a very convenient way to look up 99% of what you need to know.

Verilog-2001: What's New: This white paper by Stuart Sutherland crystalizes the key differences between Verilog-1995 and Verlog-2001. ([PDF]({{< baseurl >}}/resources/verilog_2k1paper))

Parameterized Models Using Verilog 2001: This white paper by Cliff Cummings clearly describes the evils of unnamed parameter instations and 'defines and shows how the new features in Verilog-2001 provide much safer ways to achieve the same effects.
